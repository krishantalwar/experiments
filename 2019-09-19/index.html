	<h3>now understand some basics first<h3>

<h2>what is the version control system?</h2>
<p>version control system helps the developer or person it to see back what changes he do in his file. In general, we say that it maintains records of our changes that we do in our file.</p>
<h3> let understand by example </h3>
<p>you have a phone. you use WhatsApp or any other app. after some time to time company realize the new version. exactly that git make a version of your file. that you can see and use any time.</p>

<h3>try another example</h3>
<p>when you save a document first time it gives name (v1). then again you do some add or delete content in the document and save it. it give name(v2).This assumes as file version. </p>

<h2>what is git?</h2>
<p>Git is command line (VCM) Version Control System it's also called (SCM) Software Configuration Management. In gernal we can say (SCM) is Source Code Manager, Software Change Manager. git is locally stored on the computer.</p>

<h3>let understand by example</h3> 

<p>Assume you writing a document. you save a document. Git makes a record of your document. Another day you add or delete content in document. there we exactly need VCM(git). what he does. he makes a record of your document what you add or delete in document. he provides the ability to check back what you have done and now where are you.
it maintains a record of your changes in a file. you may change a file several time it maintain all records of those changes.</p>

<h2>how git work?</h2>
<p>Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots.every time you commit or save the state of your project Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. if files have not changed Git doesnâ€™t store the file again just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. </p>

<h2>what is git-hub?</h2>

<p>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command-line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface.</p>
  
<h2>what is repositary?</h2>

<p>A repository is a container that holds the all the files related your project. These files may contain your project code and another important file. </p>

It is a file where you write software documentation. if anyone visits your repository. how he able understand what you done. in that situation readme file is there to help him to understand it.</p>
